Repo for the publication entitled "Radiomics in differential diagnosis of Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma with adrenal location in children" which was published in European Radiology.
Parameter file can be reorganized according to the requirements of the radiomics feature extraction process. 
Two jupyter notebook files are provided: First notebook, prep_dataset.ipynp guides the reader to build different dataset partitions for the project. Second notebook, select_and_train.ipynb guides the reader to select robust, non-redundant and relevant features and train with SVM and RF. In the second notebook the code for center based dataset partition was displayed. Using the dataset partition conforming to machine based partition which was displayed in the first notebook can be applied with the provided code in the second notebook as well.
